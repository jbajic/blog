title: About me
---

I am Jure, and I am using this blogsite to share what I have learned,
to try to formalize the ideas I have and insights I have gained.

I am mostly interested in database systems and I will focus my posts
around that area, but I will not be a stranger to dabble into other stuff
as well.

I have worked with various technologies so far in my career, but my focus
now is on Rust, C++ and Python.
